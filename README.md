# Project description

This project aims as practice for an LSTM model, that embeds the input data, and predicts an output. 

The first attempt of this model was trained on the tiny Shakespeare text, with the goal of predicting the next word given a set of words. 
The eventual goal of this project is to train it on Beethoven's musical notes (using data available in Music21), so that given a sequence of notes, it could predict the next few notes in the style of Beethoven.
